Arrow functions are a concise way to write functions in JavaScript, introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6). They provide a more compact syntax compared to traditional function expressions and also have some differences in how they handle the `this` keyword.

Here's a basic syntax for arrow functions:

```javascript
// Traditional function expression
const traditionalFunction = function (parameter) {
  return parameter + 1;
};

// Arrow function equivalent
const arrowFunction = (parameter) => parameter + 1;
```

Key points about arrow functions:

1. **Conciseness:** Arrow functions are often shorter than traditional function expressions, especially when the function body is a single expression.

2. **Implicit Return:** If the function body consists of a single expression, you can omit the curly braces `{}` and the `return` keyword. The result of the expression is implicitly returned.

   ```javascript
   const add = (a, b) => a + b;
   ```

3. **No `this` Binding:** Arrow functions do not have their own `this` context. They inherit `this` from the enclosing scope. This can be beneficial in certain situations, but it's essential to be aware of the differences.

   ```javascript
   function TraditionalFunction() {
     this.value = 1;

     setTimeout(function () {
       this.value++;
       console.log(this.value); // This would result in NaN because the function has its own 'this' context.
     }, 1000);
   }

   function ArrowFunction() {
     this.value = 1;

     setTimeout(() => {
       this.value++;
       console.log(this.value); // This works as expected, as the arrow function inherits 'this' from the outer scope.
     }, 1000);
   }

   // Usage
   // new TraditionalFunction(); // Would result in NaN in the console.
   // new ArrowFunction(); // Would log 2 in the console after 1000 milliseconds.
   ```
