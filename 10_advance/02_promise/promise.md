Promises are used to manage the flow of asynchronous code and make it more readable and maintainable. Promises represent a value that may be available now, in the future, or never.

A promise has three states:

1. Pending: The initial state, before the operation is completed.
2. Fulfilled: The state when the operation is successfully completed, and the result is available.
3. Rejected: The state when the operation encounters an error or is unsuccessful.

Promises have a `then` method that allows you to specify what should happen when the promise is fulfilled or rejected. You can also use the `catch` method to handle errors that occur during the promise's execution.

Here's an example of how to create and use a promise in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Create a promise
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Simulate an asynchronous operation (e.g., fetching data from a server)
  setTimeout(() => {
    const data = { message: "Promise fulfilled!" };
    // Resolve the promise with data
    resolve(data);
    // Reject the promise with an error (if needed)
    // reject(new Error("Promise rejected!"));
  }, 2000);
});

// Handle the promise using .then and .catch
myPromise
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result.message); // Output: Promise fulfilled!
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error.message); // This will not be executed in this example
  });
```
